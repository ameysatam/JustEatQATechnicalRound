1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
      
Answer: I spent 6 hours on the technical test. If I had more time I would:
    1. Have added Pytest module to the code to check whether the Postal Code matches with the one entered.
    2. Have found the names of the restaurants matching the postal code provided along with their link for easy browsing of the user.
    3. Would have added Headless browsing functionality so that the actual browser would not be needed to be launch, while the code runs in the background. Currently I have looped over 5 restaurants only, will loop over all the restaurants.
    4. Would have then divided the restaurant as per the choice of the user like Pizza, American, Chinese, Indian, etc.


2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation? 
   
Answer: The most interesting trend in automation is automation itself. Many companies are moving to automation of Front-end as well as back-end. This is reducing the time for program delivery.


3.	How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
      
Answer: It depends on the code used in the legacy application. I had implemented automation using Selenium with Python in MS CRM D365 application which use C# for development. It was difficult because no one had knowledge of Python and Google was my only friend.

4.	How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
      
Answer: From manually testing the website, I realised that the filter option was not proper, I did not have any idea whether the filtered results were the nearest or farthest. I also realized that the results were not uniform, in different iterations over first 5 search results, the outcome was different, the restaurants were from different area code.
